# StringSorter
## Description
This is a test with my implementation of dynamic strings in C++. The program also makes care of sorting strings if you want to and return the list of strings in reverse lexicographic order, insensitive to case.
## How to build
You can use this cmake command in the command line to build the project:
### Without tests
cmake .\CMakeLists.txt -G "Unix Makefiles"
### With tests
cmake .\CMakeLists_with_tests.txt -G "Unix Makefiles"

Then just type "make" command into the command line.
